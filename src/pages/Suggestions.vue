          description="I generally find myself on the more skeptical part of the AI related conversations, especially with the recent hypes. Not that I am scared of it, but rather I still see it as a parrot which is extremely capable at certain things. I find phrases like -PhD level intelligence- quite funny.
          
          I like this paper because it forces this parrot to do things he is not capable of."
