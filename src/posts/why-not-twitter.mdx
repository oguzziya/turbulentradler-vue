One of the main reasons of developing this website was to have a blog spot so that I can dump my ideas. However, after developing nearly everything, I have realized that I do not want to write in blog post format. Blog post sounds like a huge effort, which did not help with my procastination.

Then I realized that I miss Twitter, dumping my ideas into a place, without giving too much thought on them. I closed my Twitter account because I kept checking Turkish news, which do not play well with my mental health. I do not trust my self-control of not checking the timeline, therefore Twitter is a no-go for the time being.

In the end what I wanted is:
* Easy to post. I do not want to put too much effort into writing and preparing stuff.
* It cannot be a social media.
* No comment or like functionality. These are too low-effort way of presenting opinions. And to be honest, in very rare occasions I give a fuck about them. There are enough communication channels. If someone wants so say something, there is a way to do it.

So, here we are. Just a timeline to dump some random thoughts. Enjoy.
